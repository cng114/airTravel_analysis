# airTravel_analysis
The dataset that was analyzed contained the summaries of air travel within the U.S including 149 passengers and 16 variables: destination city, origin city, age, gender, type of travel, departure delay in minutes, arrival delay in minutes, flight cancelled, flight time in minutes, flight distance, likelihood to recommend, olong, olat, dlong, dlat, and free text. The data was analyzed using histograms, boxplots, tables, and maps. The most statistically significant variable which contributed the most to the likelihood of recommendation was the passenger’s age. In order to improve likelihood_to_recommend for all passengers, it is necessary to reduce the amount of delays, whether it be the origin or departure delay. This is shown in the “high confidence rule” as the probability of a passenger experiencing a delay resulting in a poor recommendation was high, being 1.0, or 100% likely.
